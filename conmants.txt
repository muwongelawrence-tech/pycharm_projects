DELETING FAILED WORKFLOWS USING TERMINAL 

Step 1: Install GitHub CLI (if not installed)
--> sudo apt install gh  # Linux (Debian-based)
--> brew install gh      # macOS
--> winget install GitHub.cli  # Windows

Step 2: Authenticate GitHub CLI
--> gh auth login

Step 3: write a bash script and paste in the following 
#!/bin/bash

REPO="muwongelawrence-tech/pycharm_projects"

echo "Fetching failed workflow runs for repository: $REPO"
gh run list --repo "$REPO" --status failure --json databaseId | jq -r '.[].databaseId' | while read -r run_id; do
  if [[ -n "$run_id" ]]; then
    echo "Submitting deletion request for run ID: $run_id"
    gh run delete "$run_id" --repo "$REPO"
    sleep 2  # Add a small delay to avoid API rate limits
  else
    echo "⚠️ No failed workflow runs found."
  fi
done

echo "✅ Deletion requests have been sent for all failed workflow runs!"

Step 4: Make the script executable:
--> sudo chmod +x delete_failed_runs.sh

Step 5: Run the script to delete the failed workflows in batches 
--> sudo ./delete_failed_runs.sh

or Run the script multiple times while sleeping for some seconds 
--> while ./delete_failed_runs.sh; do sleep 10; done
